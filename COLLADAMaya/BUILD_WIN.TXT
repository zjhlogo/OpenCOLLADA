++ Building for windows

Requirements:
-------------
To build the COLLADAMaya plug-in, you need following installations:
-	Autodesk Maya, including the SDK
Supported versions of Autodesk Maya are:
	Autodesk Maya 2011
	Autodesk Maya 2012
	Autodesk Maya 2013
	Autodesk Maya 2014
	Autodesk Maya 2015
	Autodesk Maya 2016
	Autodesk Maya 2017
	Autodesk Maya 2018

-	Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 (for loading the solution, 2012 may work too)
    AND additioal versions of Visual Studio depending of the Maya version:
        Visual 2008 for Maya 2011-2012
	Visual 2010 for Maya 2013-2014
	Visual 2012 for Maya 2014-2016
	Visual 2012 update 4 for Maya 2017
        Visual Studio 2015 update 3 for Maya 2018


You find the MVS solution file in COLLADAMaya/COLLADAMaya.sln


The project's build is tested for: win32, x64

Build:
------
Before you start to build, you have to check the following environment 
variables are correctly defined. Replace 2011 with the version you want to compile for:

MAYA_PATH2011 and/or MAYA_PATH2011_X64

Note: only X64 is supported in most recent versions of Maya, so only the _X64 variable is needed.

For example:
MAYA_PATH2015_X64=C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Maya2015

This will create a dynamic library called "COLLADAMaya.mll". The file 
will be created in the output folder and automatically copied into the folder 
 'bin/plug-ins' of your Autodesk Maya installation.


The solution configuration "ReleaseConsole" and "DebugConsole" create
the "COLLADAMaya.exe" file in the output folder and will be copied into the
"./OpenCOLLADA/COLLADAMaya/testsuite" folder. If you start the "testAllFiles.bat",
all maya files in the current directory and all sub-directories will be 
converted to collada "dae" files and checked with the coherency checker.

For help on installation, please read the INSTALL_WIN.TXT file.
